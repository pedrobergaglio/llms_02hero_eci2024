# LLMs: From Zero to (almost) Hero

## Instructor: Giovanni Trappolini
Research Fellow at Sapienza University

## Program Overview

Welcome to the "LLMs: From Zero to (almost) Hero" course. This repository contains all the materials and resources you will need throughout the course. Below is an outline of the program:

### Theoric Basics
- **Linear Regression:** Learn the fundamental principles of linear regression, a basic yet powerful statistical technique for predicting a dependent variable based on one or more independent variables.
- **Logistic Regression:** Understand logistic regression, a statistical method for modeling the probability of a binary outcome.
- **MLP: Multilayer Perceptron / Backpropagation:** Dive into neural networks with a focus on MLP and the backpropagation algorithm, which is crucial for training deep learning models.

### Language Modeling I
Explore the basics of language modeling, which involves predicting the next word in a sequence given the words that precede it. Understand the foundational concepts and techniques used in creating language models.

### Language Modeling II
Continue with more advanced language modeling techniques and applications. Learn how to improve the performance of language models and apply them to various NLP tasks.

### Transformers
- **BERT:** Learn about BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a powerful transformer-based model designed to understand the context of words in a sentence.
- **GPT:** Explore the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model, which is used for generating human-like text based on the input it receives.

### Advanced Concepts
Delve into more complex and cutting-edge topics in the field of language modeling and NLP. These may include but are not limited to transformer architectures, transfer learning, and fine-tuning for specific tasks.

### Interactivity and Breaks
The course includes interactive sessions and breaks to facilitate better understanding and engagement.

### Exam
At the end of the course, there will be a multiple-choice exam to assess your understanding of the material covered.
